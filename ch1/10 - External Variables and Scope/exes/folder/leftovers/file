Jason Lipshutz of Billboard characterized "Style" as a pop rock song,[9] while t
he Los Angeles Times's Mikael Wood and The Observer's Kitty Empire described the
 track's style as "funk-pop".[14][15] Time's Sam Lansky categorized "Style" as 1
970s-styled disco,[16] and Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield noted the song's 1980s 
synth-pop sound.[17] The refrain's first half is built on D and G major chords t
hat create a relatively radiant atmosphere. The second half incorporates a B min
or chord that evokes a glimpse of sorrow.[18] Like the rest of 1989, the track u
ses heavy synthesizers, vocal reverberation and features an upbeat dance groove,
 a dramatic change from Swift's trademark country styles.[19][20][21] The refrai
n is accompanied by "undulating waves" of keyboards underneath.[22] Alexis Petri
dis of The Guardian compared the song's electronic-oriented styles to those on t
he soundtrack of the 2011 film Drive and Daft Punk's 2013 album Random Access Me
mories.[23]
