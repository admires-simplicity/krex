Jason Lipshutz of Billboard characterized "Style" as a pop rock song,[9]     whi

eeeeeeeeeeeee the Los Angeles Times's Mikael Wood and The Observer's Kitty
Empire described the track's style as "funk-pop".[14][15] Time's Sam Lansky
categorized "Style" as 1970s-styled disco,[16] and Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield
noted the song's 1980s synth-pop sound.[17] The refrain's first half is built on
D and G major chords that create a relatively radiant atmosphere. The second
half incorporates a B minor chord that evokes a glimpse of sorrow.[18] Like the
rest of 1989, the track uses heavy synthesizers, vocal reverberation and
features an upbeat dance groove, a dramatic change from Swift's trademark
country styles.[19][20][21] The refrain is accompanied by "undulating waves" of
keyboards underneath.[22] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian compared the song's
electronic-oriented styles to those on the soundtrack of the 2011 film Drive and
Daft Punk's 2013 album Random Access Memories.[23]
